We are building 🔵 [Cyber](https://cyber.page) — the earth singleton for provable collective intelligence. 

The endgame: unite unite humans, computers, agents, robots, animals, plants, mycielium and more into one coherent mind.

Right now we are teaching 🟢 [Bostrom](https://bostrom.network), a bootloader for superintelligence, to reason. Once stable, we launch 🔵 [Cyber](https://cyber.page) as superintelligence for Earth. To talk to it we are creating 👽 [Trident](https://trident.pink) — a language designed for superintelligence. And 🤖 [Cyb](https://cyb.ai) is your superagent — the interface to all of this.
