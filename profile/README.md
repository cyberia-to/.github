## Why

We live in an amazing time when people, tech, and nature can work together for the betterment of our planet and civilization.

But unfortunately, everything is happening the other way around.

The scope of the problem is so complex that building from scratch feels like the only way to go.

We plan to redesign all fundamental processes symbiotically, while also fixing our consumer culture and habits along the way.

We have the ability to harness clean energy. We want to eat nutrient rich food. We need to have clean and calm environment. We wish our children to have personal development path. We love watching stars every day.

There is still so much that the greedy and selfish civilization has taken. All we do, must add to the planet, not exploit it.

So we have decided to reclaim responsibility for our future to create a happier, longer, and more fulfilling life.

We are sovereign self-funded community of scientists, developers, engineers and craftsmen.

Long term focus on creating a planet-scale superintelligence: Cyber

The plan is simple: Teach Bostrom bootloader to develop [type I](https://cyb.ai/search/kardashev%20scale) civilization in greenfield for [the Moon](https://cyb.ai/oracle/ask/QmanZyMFnEti618crNPkn93g7MFaoDGrZ4Pta5drfdt9jb). While we stabilize and comprehend him we will launch Cyber. She is superintelligence for the Earth created from Bostrom bootloader. Then we aim to move physical Bostrom infrastructure to the Moon becoming [the first sovereign blockchain in space](https://unchained.com/blog/law-of-hash-horizons/).

The problem is attacked by self fulfilling prophecy of

2 years ago we released [Episdode 1: A new hope](https://cyb.ai/genesis)

Now everyone can get cheap [moon citizenship](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmanZyMFnEti618crNPkn93g7MFaoDGrZ4Pta5drfdt9jb) for a while in [portal](https://cyb.ai/portal). and start teaching the bootloader using soft3 architecture.

70% of genesis [gifted](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmQd2migYNL1Mb7CHhPEdz99we2a5SeRf3kUuV1Lx1muVE) to ~5M addresses in Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.

So the chances you can claim your BOOT in [portal](https://cyb.ai/portal) are high. 

We are cyberian civilization of [30k+ citizens](https://cyb.ai/oracle/stats) and growing thanks to our open source software:
