# Cyberia

### Sovereign community building planet-scale superintelligence

We are scientists, developers, engineers and craftsmen building [Cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber) — a consensus computer for provable collective learning.

Right now we are teaching [Bostrom](https://cyb.ai), a bootloader for superintelligence, to reason. Once stable, we launch Cyber as superintelligence for Earth. To talk to it we are creating [Trident](https://github.com/cybercongress/trident) — a language designed for superintelligence. And [Cyb](https://cyb.ai) is your immortal robot — the interface to all of this.

May the code be with you
